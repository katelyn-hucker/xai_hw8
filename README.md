# Adversarial Patches Homework 
## Katie Hucker 

The attached notebook file follows a tutorial provided by Phillip Lippe cited below. Instead of the sample images and patches generated in the tutorial, I created a stingray patch and used leatherback turtles and bald eagles as my test attack prediction.  I added code and steps to disguise a stingray patch as an animal tracking tag. I did this by adding white borders and various lines that we typically see on trackers. Attached in this repo are both patches to see quickly.
